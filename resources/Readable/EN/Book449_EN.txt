Wary Traveler, what brings you to this deep, underground cave?
Is it the legendary tales of Hasad the Golden Adventurer?
This renowned tale told the world over is but a speck of sand compared to what I've experienced.
Only the Nameless god of the desert knows what terrible misfortune has befallen me.
Any of those people aren't able to glimpse the ancient secrets
They have put me under the layers of many curses
And I have become an oracle of an invisible creature.

The evil spirit watching me from the shadows set forth three challenges for me
To bring forth the hidden treasures brought from the cursed city of brass
If fear can't stop you from giving into greed and curiosity
Just follow my path

Through the deep tunnel to that filthy pit where Dev had lived
The ruins echoed with cries and screams of death.

When the flames are lit in the correct order
In the way you came
I'll be free from this endless curse

But those eternal beings can never perish
Even death has its limitations.

Deep in the desert of eternal desolation, there are things even older than the ancient pyramids.
A sinister whisper from the spirit of Ajif, each one of them repeating that accursed name
Hirouy.
